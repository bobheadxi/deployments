# GitHub Deployments [![View Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-github%20action-yellow.svg)](https://bobheadxi.dev/r/deployments/)

`bobheadxi/deployments` is a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for working painlessly with deployment statuses.
Instead of exposing convoluted Action configuration that mirrors that of the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) like some of the other available Actions do, this Action simply exposes a number of configurable, easy-to-use "steps" common to most deployment flows.

- [Features](#features)
  - [`step: start`](#step-start)
  - [`step: finish`](#step-finish)
  - [`step: deactivate-env`](#step-deactivate-env)
- [Debugging](#debugging)

A simple example:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
    - name: start deployment
      uses: bobheadxi/deployments@v0.6.2
      id: deployment
      with:
        step: start
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        env: release

    - name: do my deploy
      # ...

    - name: update deployment status
      uses: bobheadxi/deployments@v0.6.2
      if: always()
      with:
        step: finish
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        deployment_id: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.deployment_id }}
```

## Features

### `step: start`

This is best used on the `push: { branches: [ ... ] }` event, but you can also have `release: { types: [ published ] }` trigger this event.
`start` should be followed by whatever deployment tasks you want to do, and it creates and marks a deployment as "started":

The following [`inputs`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith) are available:

### `step: finish`

This is best used after `step: start` and should follow whatever deployment tasks you want to do in the same workflow.
`finish` marks an in-progress deployment as complete:

### `step: deactivate-env`

This is best used on the `pull_request: { types: [ closed ] }` event, since GitHub does not seem to provide a event to detect when branches are deleted.
This step can be used to automatically shut down deployments you create on pull requests and mark environments as destroyed:

![env destroyed](.static/destroyed.png)

The following [`inputs`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith) are available:

| Variable | Default                     | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `step`   |                             | must be `deactivate-env` for this step                                     |
| `token`  |                             | provide your `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` for API access                  |
| `logs`   | URL to GitHub commit checks | URL of your deployment logs                                                |
| `desc`   |                             | description for this deployment                                            |
| `env`    |                             | identifier for environment to deploy to (e.g. `staging`, `prod`, `master`) |

<details>
<summary>Simple Example</summary>

    - name: do my deployment shutdown

      uses: bobheadxi/deployments@v0.6.2

        desc: Deployment was pruned
```

## Debugging

The argument `log_args: true` can be provided to print arguments used by `deployments`.
